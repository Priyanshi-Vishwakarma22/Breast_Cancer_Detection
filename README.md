# Breast_Cancer_Detection

## 📌Overview
This project aims to predict the survival outcome of breast cancer patients using machine learning models based on clinical and diagnostic features. By analysing historical medical data, the system classifies whether a patient is likely to survive or not.

The project follows a **modular machine learning pipeline architecture**, including data ingestion, transformation, model training, and evaluation.

---

## 🚀Project Objective

* Develop an accurate predictive model
* Estimate breast cancer survival outcomes
* Enable early decision-making
* Improve treatment planning

---

## 🧠Problem Statement

Predicting breast cancer survival is complex due to multiple clinical factors, and existing methods may lack accuracy. Therefore, an efficient machine learning model is needed to accurately predict survival outcomes and support better medical decision-making.
